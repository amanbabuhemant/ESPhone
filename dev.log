Created keypad feature and also the keypad, was first planing to implementing a
keypad with individual key detection... But the number of keys was a problem so
implemented keypad as a matrix keypad, currently a 2x2 keypad, because I don't
have enough jumper wires to connect all switches I planned, or I should try
some short wire pieces.

Created API for screen with some basic drawing functions, will extends screen
library for more shapes and GUI components.

The Screen API is a wrapper of SSD1306 API for providing some high level
functions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Created basic but I think sufficient APIs to interact with SSD1306 display,
most of the part was copy pasted because I can't remember the I2C and SSD1306
init process, atleast for now.

Just initiated the project
