Worked on UI library, and also found some issues in my text library.

The First issue was with the rendering.. Text was rendering 1 pixel taller then
expected, I leave this for now. The second issue was with string width function
which I have fixed in current commit.

The UI library currently containing 3 basic widgets, Label, Button and Entry.
More widgets will be added but first I have to implement Events and some default
event handling to currently available widgets. But the testing might require to
build some dummy apps... And for that I will require some more libraries...
So I am not sure how I am going to test it now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was just wondering how good this approach is... This just technique just
spawned in my head last night and worked very good.

For font I was just worried about... How text with different size will render...
How we can do styling on text.. My initial plan was to store pixel/bit map of
characters and, different size arrays for different fonts... One for 8 pixel
height one for 10 pixel and one for 12...

But, we can also store characters in form of strokes.. Like "A" can be drawn
with 3 strokes, we can store the in form of points, then we can render that on
screen, and we can multiply and calculate new coordinates for each point then
render.. This approach can be consider a small-simple .ttf formate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Created keypad feature and also the keypad, was first planing to implementing a
keypad with individual key detection... But the number of keys was a problem so
implemented keypad as a matrix keypad, currently a 2x2 keypad, because I don't
have enough jumper wires to connect all switches I planned, or I should try
some short wire pieces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Created API for screen with some basic drawing functions, will extends screen
library for more shapes and GUI components.

The Screen API is a wrapper of SSD1306 API for providing some high level
functions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Created basic but I think sufficient APIs to interact with SSD1306 display,
most of the part was copy pasted because I can't remember the I2C and SSD1306
init process, atleast for now.

Just initiated the project
